# 📊 My Pandas Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋 I'm Rishabh Joshi, a budding data enthusiast from Meerut, India. I'm currently exploring the powerful world of pandas 🐼 to enhance my skills in data analysis and business analytics.

This repository is a collection of my hands-on experiments, code snippets, and notes as I learn and grow in the field of data science.

## 🧠 What is pandas?

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrames, which are essential for handling structured data.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing my practice exercises and mini-projects.
- `datasets/`: Sample datasets used for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Standalone Python scripts for specific tasks.
- `resources.md`: A curated list of tutorials, articles, and documentation I've found helpful.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebooks and scripts:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
